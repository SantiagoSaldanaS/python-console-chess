rule1=\n{menu_white}BOARD{reset}\n\nThe chessboard is the battlefield,\ncomposed of 64 squares. Each side of the board\nhas eight squares (8 x 8 = 64).\n\nTo learn more about the board go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/el-tablero
rule2=\n{menu_white}PIECES{reset}\n\nThe pieces are divided, by convention, into white\nand black. The players are called 'White' and 'Black',\nand each begins the game with sixteen pieces\nof their color: a king, a queen, two rooks, two bishops,\ntwo knights, and eight pawns.\n\nTo learn more about the pieces go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/laspiezas
rule3=\n{menu_white}TURNS{reset}\n\nWhite always moves first, followed by players\ntaking turns to move one piece at a time\n(except for castling, where two pieces are moved simultaneously).\nThe pieces move either to a free square or one\noccupied by an opponent's piece, which is\ncaptured and removed from the board.\n\nTo learn more about turns go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/movimiento
rule4=\n{menu_white}CASTLING{reset}\n\nThe king can make a special move\nwith the rook called castling.\n\nThis consists of crossing the rook with the king,\nmoving the king two squares on the first\nrank and placing the rook on the other side of the king.\n\nTo learn more about castling go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/enroque
rule5=\n{menu_white}CHECK{reset}\n\nWhen a king is under immediate attack by one\nor more of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check.\nThe only allowed responses to a check are:\n - Capture the piece giving check\n - Place a piece between the checking piece and the\nking (unless the attacking piece is a knight)\n - Move the king to a square that is not under attack.\n\nTo learn more about check go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/el-jaque
rule6=\n{menu_white}CHECKMATE{reset}\n\nThe objective of the game is checkmate, which occurs\nwhen the king is threatened with capture\n(check) and cannot avoid it.\n\nThe game doesn't always end in checkmate:\n - Any player can surrender if the situation seems hopeless.\n - In a timed game, a player can run out of time and lose, even with a superior position.\n - Games can also end in a draw.\n\nTo learn more about checkmate go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/final-del-juego
rule7=\n{menu_white}DRAWS{reset}\n\nA game is considered a draw when there is a tie,\nwhich can happen in several situations:\n\n - Mutual agreement\n - Insufficient material: not enough pieces are left to\ncheckmate.\n - Stalemate\n - Triple repetition of the same position\n - Fifty-move rule\n\nTo learn more about draws go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/tablas
rule8=\n{menu_white}PROMOTION{reset}\n\nWhen a pawn reaches the other side of the board,\nit promotes.\n\nThis means that the player chooses a queen, rook,\nknight, or bishop (of their own color), and places that piece\nin the square previously occupied by the pawn.\n\nTo learn more about promotion go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/reglas-basicas/Promocion-del-peon
rule9=\n{menu_white}ALGEBRAIC NOTATION{reset}\n\nOver the years, several codifications have been developed\nto reflect the position of pieces or the moves made\nduring a chess game. Notation allows us to recreate games played\nby grandmasters to review their moves and learn from them.\n\nAdditionally, notation is required to play in tournaments,\ncompose or study chess problems, and understand chess books.\n\nTo learn more about notation go to\nhttps://www.123ajedrez.com/miscelanea/notacin
rule10=\n{menu_white}OFFICIAL RULES{reset}\n\nThe official chess rules are regulated by the\nWorld Chess Federation. They are divided into four sections:\n\n - Basic rules of play:\n   https://www.123ajedrez.com/miscelanea/leyes-del-ajedrez/LeyesReglasBasicas\n\n - Competition rules:\n   https://www.123ajedrez.com/miscelanea/leyes-del-ajedrez/leyescompeticion\n\n - Appendices:\n   https://www.123ajedrez.com/miscelanea/leyes-del-ajedrez/leyesapendices\n\n - Glossary:\n   https://www.123ajedrez.com/miscelanea/leyes-del-ajedrez/glosario

program_notation=\n\n{menu_white}PROGRAM NOTATION.{reset}
notation_explanation1=\nIn chess, moves are usually written using something called\ncompact notation (e.g., Nf3). However, this is not the only way to represent them.\nIn fact, compact notation is officially defined as short algebraic notation (other types of algebraic notation are long (Ng1f3) and minimal (Nf3)).\nThere are also notations outside the algebraic system, such as descriptive or English notation (N3KR),\nICCF numeric (7163), Smith notation (g1f3), and coordinate notation (G1-F3), among others.
notation_explanation2=This program will exclusively use Smith notation (g1f3). This consists\nof taking the starting square coordinates, and the destination square,\nand combining them without spaces or symbols. However, special letters\n(like captured piece) are sometimes added to moves such as captures, castling, and promotion. For simplicity, the program will not include these symbols. To promote, use a format like: g7g8=Q (where Q is Queen or the piece you're promoting to). To castle,\nonly define the king's square with the square it will end on after castling (for example e1g1). Finally, to capture an opponent’s piece,\nsimply jump to the square of the enemy piece (e4d5).
notation_explanation3=\nYou don't need to include the symbols for check (+), capture (x), or piece (Q, N, K, R, etc.).

first_test=Now that this is explained, let's move on to a practical example to learn Smith notation.\n\n{menu_white}Move the knight from d4 to e6.{reset}
second_test=\n{menu_white}Now, castle the king to either side.{reset}
third_test=\n{menu_white}Now, promote the pawn to a rook for checkmate.{reset}
fourth_test=\n{menu_white}Finally, capture en passant the black pawn that just advanced.{reset}

finish_test=\n{menu_white}Well done! Congratulations, you have completed the notation tutorial.\nYou can review it anytime from the tutorial menu.{reset}

tutorial_commands=\n\n{menu_white}COMMANDS.{reset}
tutorial_commands_explanation=\nDuring any game, you'll have access to commands with different functions.\nFrom resigning to getting the FEN code of the current position, you can do a variety of things using commands. To execute a command, you must use the forward slash (/).\n\nBelow is a list of available commands:
